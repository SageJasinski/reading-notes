# Operators and Loops

## Comparison operators

A comparison opperator is an opperator that will compare both sides of the operator based on the type of operator you use.

```
b = 5
5 == b
```

Above is passing the equals operator which means that the number 5 is equal to the variable b.

## Assignment operators

An assignment operators is an operator that assigns the right value to the left value.

```
a = 'how's it going'
```

In this case we assign the string value to a.

## For loops

A for loop will continually run until the specified code becomes false.

```
for (<first>; <condition>; <increment>){<statement>}
```

This will run the first expression through the specified conditions at your specified increment through the statement until the expression returns false.

## While

A while statement is the opposite of a for loop. A while statement will only run as long as the specified condition is true.

```
while (<specified condition>){<statement>}
```
It is important to note that the condition must return false at some point otherwise the while statement will continually loop.
