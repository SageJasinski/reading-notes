# Reading Notes

## About Me

Hello my name is Sage Jasinski. I used to code as a hobby making small games for my younger siblings to play or even just making little raspberry pi projects around the house. I am here at code fellows because I want to turn my love of coding into a career to help support my growing family. I have always been drawn to technology, watching every tech event reveal I could find since I was little. My wife and I enjoy gaming, wether that be board game, card game, or video game, and we are always on the look out for a new game to try.
