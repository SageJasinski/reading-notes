## About Me

How's it going my name is Sage Jasinski, I currently work as a QA test team lead but this has not quenched my thirst for code. Growing up if I didn't know how something worked I would do anything to learn about it. This came back to bite me when I became interested in how coding worked. At first it was a simple game for my little brothers and sister but that only showed me how much I really didn't know. Nowadays you can find me working on little projects here and there or playing video games and nerd games with my wife. For my fellow nerds I enjoy Magic the gathering, Dungeons and Dragons and all sorts of other adventure type games. My ultimate goal is to help build apps and web pages that change the world.
