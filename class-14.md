## CSS Transforms

CSS trans formation allows you to position and size objects in a new way by declaring things like scale, or degrees. I could see my self using this method quite a lot to reposition images or transform div elements.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

The transition attribute in CSS allows you to specify things like time and type of transition to the new attributes of the element. The animation attribute allows you to set a key frame and give it different properties at different percentages which totally 100% of the animations run time. Some benefits to using transitions are that it will engage the user with your content more and can even convey non verbal things to the user such as if a user can't use a certain button you can give it the shake transition to tell the user it is unavailable to them. I fell that in every project going forward I will be using transitions and animations.

## Googles quest to build the perfect team

During there research google found it hard to find any corelation between a team that worked effectivity with each other and those that didn't. After much study they found that the key was UNderstanding and influencing group norms sometimes refereed to as "unspoken rules" or they way we interact with one another when we gather. It is important to balance the emotional exhaustion as well as the productivity of the team and individuals.
