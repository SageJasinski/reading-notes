## CSS Transforms

CSS trans formation allows you to position and size objects in a new way by declaraing things like scale, or degrees. I could see my self using this method quite a lot to reposition images or transform div elements.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

The transition attribute in CSS allows you to specify things like time and type of transition to the new attributes of the element. The animation attribute allows you to set a key frame and give it different properties at different percentages which totally 100% of the animations run time. Some benefits to using transitions are that it will engage the user with your content more and can even convey non verbal things to the user such as if a user can't use a certain button you can give it the shake transition to tell the user it is unavailable to them. I fell that in every project going forward I will be using transitions and animations.
