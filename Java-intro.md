# Java intro

## What is Javascript

Javascript controls the functionality of the page. Javascript is an object oriented language that can give your web page or app the interactive capabilities that you desire.

## Lets talk Variable

There are three different ways you can define a variable in javascript:

```javascript
let name = "value"
const name = "value"
var name = "value"
```

The last definer **var** is an older definer and hardly used. it is important to know the difference between **let** and **const**. The let definer is used for variables that can be allowed to change. The const definer is used for variables which should remain constant and unchanging.

## Some helpful functions

You can use the `prompt()` function to get a user interaction.

To check the value of a variable you can use the `console.log()` which will print the value in the console.

`document.wright()` will place your value on the page

Remember that wherever you place or call your script within the html file that is where it will show up on the page.
