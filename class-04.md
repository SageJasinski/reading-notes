## HTML

In order to create a link to another page you can use the `<a>` tag with the **href** attribute. The **href** attribute will store the path or URL of the link you want to have the user go to. To increase accessibility make sure you add clear descriptors to your tag that tell the user where the link goes.

## CSS

When you load up a webpage with no added css you get what is called normal flow css or the default styling applied to the web page. When putting elements on a page you can use either block or inline elements. It is important to know which you are working with in CSS because each behave differently.

- Block elements will always be displayed in a new box around other elements
- Inline elements will be displayed on the same line they are called on and can even be inside a box element.

Each html element starts with static positioning and can be changed via the CSS by using the position attribute. Yuo can set an element to an absolute position which will the position it relative to it's nearest position actors. Using absolute positioning is very useful because it allows you to separate the flow and create UI elements that do not interfere with the rest of the page. Fixed positioning with position the element relative to the visible view port.

## JS

A function declaration is when you define exactly what the function is doing, or the meat of the code. A function invocation is where you call when and where you want those specified things to happen. A parameter of a function is something that happens in side the paraenthases and needs to happen when you are invoking them. Parameters are sometimes called arguments.
