## Html setup

When makeing an HTML file you must start with first telling the document
what language you'll be writing in by using.

```html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
```

This will tell the page what language to read. Next is the &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; element also refered to as the root element.
this will wrap your doument in html

Next we have the &lt;head&gt; element. this will wrap everything you want that isn't content on the page. your viewer won't see this section. this can be things like search terms or css style sheets.

Last we have the &lt;body&gt; element. this is where you will put the contents of your site. everything from navigation bars to images and paragrphs will go here.

## What is a sematic?

Sematics refers to the meaning of a pice of code.
An h1 emelment, in html, will make the text it wraps look bigger and bolder but this is due to the browser and not the sematic of the element. The sematic is that the text is now labeld as a top level element and it could look any way you want it to look. The sematic is what it is doing not what it is making the element look like.

## Wireframing

Wireframing is important because it will help you decied what you want your site to look like. It is easier to make changes in a wire frame than when you are codeing.
Wireframes are ussually either hand drawn or use software to help draw out a boasic plan. Think of the wire frame like the blueprint for your website. It is important to have a water tight concept of you userflow. How do you want your user to go from one screen to the next?
How many screebs do you want to have? make sure your user is self suficiant =, they need little to no messages to explain how to use your site.
