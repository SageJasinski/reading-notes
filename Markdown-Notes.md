# Learning Markdown

### So you want to learn markdown?
Hello my good freind i'm so excited that you are interested in learning markdown, I'll be honest though I never thought you be into Markdown so let's go over the basics.

### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a Text formatting language that will let you pick how your message is displayed on your web page. Markdown is very fun and easy to grasp once you understand some key concepts

## The Key Concepts.
You will only need just a handful of key markdown concept to get your text looking sharp. These concepts you will learn are:
1. Headings
2. Bold Text
3. Block Quotes
4. Formating Links
Once you master these you will have the tools nesissary to create your masterpice of text. So lets get into it shall we?

### Headings (Just like this)
Headings are a very important part of formatting text. Without headings you wouldn't know where a section begins and ends, it would be increadably difficult to scan through an article to find relevant information. 

In markdown the way you indicate what text you want to be a heading is by using the # sign. Markdown gives you the option to have 6 diffrent sizes of headings. The way you indicate what size you want is by the number of # signs you use. One # sign is the largest heading and six # signs is the smallest heading. An example of the syntax (the way you would typw it out) is as follows:
```
# Largest heading
## ...
### ...
#### ...
#####...
###### Smallest heading
````
It is important to note that in the example above, after the last # sign has been entered a space was placed. This is done for best practices as it makes reading the mardown a lot easier. It woun't break your heading if you don't put the space there but it will look sloppy.

### Bold Text
Sometimes when your writing an important or key concept you want to **emphasise** that concept so it stands out from the rest of the words on your page. In order to make a text **bold** there are a couple diffrent ways. The first is to surround the word or phrase you want in bold with two asterisxs in the beginning and end of the word/phrase `**Such as this**`. You can even bold a word in the middle of a sentence like this ` I love **bold** text`. The other way to bold text in markdown is to use Two underscores in the beging and end of the phrase `__Have you seen this bold text__`. Both of these methodes will give you the same result but much like the Heading it is best practice to use the Underscore methode when bolding __Multiple words or phrases together__ and to use the asterisxs method when bolding **one** or more words.

### Block Quotes
Block quotes are a great way to make your text stand out and look professional. Manny websites today prefer using the block quotes methode as apossed to just using boring old quotation marks. A block quote can look something like this:

>Today I will live in the moment, Unless it is unpleasnt in which case I will eat a cookie.
>
>-Cookie Monster

As you can see it makes your quote stand out from the rest of your page. The way you use a block quote is simple starting the line with a > symbol.
```
> Here is an example of how that syntax would look when you are writing the quote
```

When you are writing your quotes it is best practice to have an empty line between where your regular text ends and your quote beggins. This will help separate the Mardown sheet and make it easier to find where your quots are all at.

### Formating links
The last methode to makeing your text look professional is to make embeded links. Sometimes having URL posted can look sloppy and break the asthetic of the article you are writing. Most often you want the opsion to just click/tap on a word that the user finds intreguing and have it take them to the places you desire. This syntax might be the hardest one here but you've stuck with me this far so i think your ready for it. The way you make a hyper link is to first surround the word you want the user to click on in squar brackets `Like [This word]` then imediatly after the brackets put the URL of the site you want linked in parenthases `Search [Google](www.google.com) for code` then when the user clicks the word it will take them to that website. An example of this would be:

Check out my [GitHub](github.com/Sagejasinski) 

When makeing links it is important to note that there is no space between the last squar bracket of the word and the begining parenthases of the URL. 

## You Made it!!
I can't belive you got this far you must be so excited to learn markdown. Ok since your so gungho about it how about a little review?

When makeing a heading you should 
! always leave a 

between your # and the beging of your heading.
