# Learning Markdown

## So you want to learn markdown?

Hello my good friend, I'm so excited that you are interested in learning markdown. I'll be honest though, I never thought you be into markdown. So let's go over the basics.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a text formatting language that will let you pick how your message is displayed on your web page. Markdown is very fun and easy to grasp once you understand some key concepts.

## The Key Concepts

You will only need a handful of key markdown concepts to get your text looking sharp. The concepts you will learn are:

1. Headings
2. Bold Text
3. Block Quotes
4. Formatting Links

Once you master these you will have the tools necessary to create your masterpiece of text. So, lets get into it, shall we?

### Headings (Just like this)

Headings are a very important part of formatting text. Without headings, you wouldn't know where a section begins and ends. It would be incredible difficult to scan through an article to find relevant information.

In markdown, the way you indicate what text you want to be a heading is by using the # sign. Markdown gives you the option to have six different sizes of headings. The way you indicate what size you want is by the number of # signs you use. One # sign is the largest heading and six # signs is the smallest heading. An example of the syntax (the way you would type it out) is as follows:

```markdown
# Largest heading
## ...
### ...
#### ...
#####...
###### Smallest heading
```

❗It is important to note that in the example above, after the last # sign has been entered, a space was placed. This is done for best practices as it makes reading the markdown easier. It wouldn't break your heading if you don't put the space there, but it will look sloppy.

### Bold Text

Sometimes, when you are writing an important or key concept, you want to **emphasize** that concept so it stands out from the rest of the words on your page. In order to make a text **bold**, there are a couple different ways. ❗The first is to surround the word or phrase you want in bold with two asterisks in the beginning and end of the word/phrase.

```markdown
**Such as this**
```

You can even bold a word in the middle of a sentence like this:

```markdown
I love **bold** text
```

The other way to bold text in markdown is to use two underscores in the beginning and end of the phrase:

```markdown
__Have you seen this bold text__
```

Both of these methods will give you the same result, but much like the heading, it is best practice to use the underscore method when bolding **multiple words or phrases together** and to use the asterisks method when bolding **one** or more words.

### Block Quotes

Block quotes are a great way to make your text stand out and look professional. Many websites today prefer using the block quotes method as opposed to just using boring old quotation marks. A block quote can look something like this:

>Today I will live in the moment, Unless it is unpleasant in which case I will eat a cookie.
>
>-Cookie Monster

As you can see, it makes your quote stand out from the rest of your page. The way you use a block quote is simple, starting the line with a > symbol.

```text
> Here is an example of how that syntax would look when you are writing the quote
```

❗When you are writing your quotes it is best practice to have an empty line between where your regular text ends and your quote begins. This will help separate the markdown sheet and make it easier to find where your quotes are at.

### Formatting Links

The last method to making your text look professional is to make embedded links. Sometimes having URL posted can look sloppy and break the aesthetic of the article you are writing. Most often, you want the option to just click/tap on a word that the user finds intriguing and have it take them to the places you desire. This syntax might be the hardest one here, but you've stuck with me this far so I think you are ready for it. The way you make a embedded link is to first surround the word you want the user to click on in square brackets

```markdown
Like [This word]
```

then immediately after the brackets, put the URL of the site you want linked in parentheses:

```markdown
Search [Google](www.google.com) for code
```

Then, when the user clicks the word, it will take them to that website. An example of this would be:

Check out my [GitHub](github.com/Sagejasinski)

❗When making links, it is important to note that there is no space between the last square bracket of the word and the beginning parentheses of the URL.

## You Made It

I can't believe you got this far, you must be so excited to learn markdown. Ok, since you are so gung-ho about it, how about a little review?

1. When making a heading, you should __________ between your # and the beginning of your heading.
2. To make a single word **bold**, you should use two ___ at the beginning and end of the word.
3. If you are making a block quote, you should leave a __________ between the last line of your sentence and the first line of your quote as best practice.
4. True or False: You should put a space between the [square brackets] and the (Parentheses) of your URL?

### Where are the answers?

The answers are in the article above. They are preceded with an ❗mark before the line that holds the answer. But I already know you got all of them correct because you are smart like that.
