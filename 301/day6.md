## Pair programing

1. six reasons for pair programing are: Greater efficiency,Engaged collaboration, Learning from fellow coders, Build social skills, Job interview readiness for job applications, and readiness for the work environment.

2. in my experience the most helpful out of the six are, Greater efficiency and learning from fellow coders. This is because when I work alone i often times can get stuck somewhere that perhaps had i been working with someone else they could have the answer and teach me along with keeping the work flow going instead of just me stopping and having to take time to figure out the problem on my own.

3. Pair programing involves two programers. One is the navigator and the other is the Driver. The Driver does all the actual coding while the navigator lets their words guid the action the driver should take.
