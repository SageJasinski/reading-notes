# Diversity and Inclusion in the Tech Industry Reading

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
    - About the same time when personal computers started showing up in US homes in large numbers

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    - The games on the computers were marketed solely towards the male audience (shooting games etc), which influenced the “nerdy goy gets the girl” plots in movies at the time, and further distanced women from coding. Once kids got to college, it was assumed that they (boys) had been playing on computers while growing up, putting women at a severe disadvantage.

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
    - When they are driven by a commitment from company leaders

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
    - Diverse groups “bring more and different ways of seeing a problem and faster or better ways to solve it”

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
    - One example in the article was when a predominantly right-handed team developed an app, there was a lot of issues because they didn’t consider left handed users. Even just simple diversity in habit/ways of thinking can mean the success of a project or its failure.
