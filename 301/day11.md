# Reading notes

1. Five differences between SQL and NoSQL
    - SQL is relational, while NoSQL is non-relational
    - SQL is table based, NoSQL is a collection of key value pair, documents, graph databases, or wide column stores
    - SQL databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL is horizontally scalable
    - SQL is good for complex query environments, while NoSQL do not have standard interfaces to perform complex queries.
    - SQL is best used for heavy duty transactional applications, while NoSQL can be best used for less complex transactions
2. SQL is best for non-hierarchical data storage
3. MySQL
4. NoSQL is best for hierarchical data storage
5. MongoDB
6. NoSQL
7. SQL

1. What does SQL stand for?
    - Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?
    - A database that works with certain assumptions and supports the SQL like tables
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    - Tables
4. What is a ‘schema’?
    - Strict requirements, fields
5. What is a NoSQL database?
    - A massive database, capable of handling far more data than a SQL database
6. How does it work?
    - Collections instead of tables, connected to documents instead of rows, not ruled by schema
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
    - Collection of data based on orders, users, products
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
    - MongoDB since you can add data without restraint of schema
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - Not sure if the data you enter in a NoSQL database will adhere to the format in the database since there is not strict schema, duplication data, no relationships
