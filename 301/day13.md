## Speed Coding: Building a Crud API

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

    - REST applications are built around resources, which can be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD)

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

    - Build the server

    - Make the server not record the state of the client

    - Server caches data from the api that is already called

    - Server makes resources available to the front end for front end use

    - Predictable outcomes in both server and client side
