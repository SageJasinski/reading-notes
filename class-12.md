# Class 12 Reading Notes

## Javascript Canvas

The `<canvas>` tag allows you to draw 2d graphics on the page. You can put any fall back content you want between the opening and closing tag. The `getcontext()` method allows you to render objects and takes one argument which will be the type of content you wish it to render.


## Chart.js

Chart,js is a simple way to implement charts using a single canvas tag. you can implement many different types of charts such as Bar, pie, and even radar charts to display the appropriate chart for the data set you are trying to represent. Charts are much better at displaying data visually than a simple table and can even be layed out in an optimal way to portray your data, where as a table can only be layed out two ways. In the past where I had used tables the umbers seemed confusing and almost meaningless, but had i had a chart it would have been much easier to see what all the numbers meant and how they corelate.
