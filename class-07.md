# Class 07 Reading Notes

## Domain modeling

Domain modelling is important as it allows you to create a skeleton of the code you would use to solve a specific problem. It is especially good if you can name variables and functions so that multiple stakeholders can understand the framework of the code that will solve their problem.

## HTML

Do not use tables for page layout as they generally include a more complex markup structure than regular layout structures. Tables are also not as responsive as tradition html elements. Just like with regular html elements there are some semantic elements you can use for tables such as:

1. `<th>` which stands for table header

2. `<td>` which stands for table data

3. `<tr>` which stands for table row

## Constructors

a constructor is just a function but called using the `new` keyword. It allows you to create an object and still use the `this` operator later on in the script.Using the `this` command in an Object will refer to anything within that object, however when using `this` in a construct it will refer to the object and not what is inside the construct.

Prototypes are similar to when your boss has you make a rough draft of a Test case and later you can come back to redefine the exact values that go into it once you have data.
