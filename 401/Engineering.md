# Engineering reading Discussion

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

   - I can bring my unique perspective and perseverance for problem-solving to the industry.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
   - First I will take a very quick break.
   - Then I will comeback and summarize what that portion of the code is doing (rubber-duck) without editing the code
   - Last I will seek peer review/help if i am still stuck on the code issue.
