## Objects and Classes

1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

    - The difference between an Object and a class is that a class is a blue print of how an object should be created. you can Model states and behaviors with classes. An object is a system of states and behoving held and passed based on reference to the parent object.

2. What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.

   - Design patters are the best practices models and solutions to many coding problems that could arise. For example in my previous work as a device tester we had a spreadsheet we would use and contribute to when designing test for products, this spreadsheet was made by test designers who had been building tests for 
     a long time and had identified certain areas which every test needed and could have easily been overlooked, it was best practice to go through the test you built and put it through that sheet to make sure you didn't miss anything. 

3. Static methods are also called what? Why?

   - Static methods are also called class methods because that static method will belong to the class rather than the object of the class.
