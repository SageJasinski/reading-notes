# Class 3 Notes

## Primitives vs Objects

The primitive types are a lot faster and take up less storage.Objects take up large amounts of storage but java does not 
support primitive types when dealing with large collections so in this case we should consider using the object 
that takes the least amount of space while maintaining the functionality we need from it.

## Exceptions in Java

An exception is something that happens when the flow of a program is interrupted.
you can use a `try Catch` statement  to run code or catch an error if the try is not met. on top of that any code may use **Throw** to throw an exception.
a **Finally** block is a block of code guaranteed to execute.

## Scanning

Scanners can scan through and separate formatted inputs into tokens. Scanners don't just sepate strings they can separate all primitive data types in Java
