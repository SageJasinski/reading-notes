# Growth mindset

- This topic matters because of the various opportunities and workloads inherent of this career path that will require the average developer to be more than average. The growth, namely the learning, should never stop for those who wish to excel beyond the mediocre.

- I found the reading on upgrading my technical skills with deliberate practice to be very relatable. While I do not yet have industry experience, so have not experienced the so called learning plateau that comes after a couple years in the workforce, I do even currently find ways outside of these courses to challenge myself. I “deliberately” practice my coding on personal applications and websites that I am creating on my own time to not only put in my portfolio, but to use in my everyday life.

- The belief in “not yet” was relatable to me in how I approach these courses. The class is fast and rigorous, but not impossible. Therefore, when I do not do as well as I hope on a quiz or assignment, we often have the opportunity to try again. I am learning but may not fully grasp the concepts “yet.” This has improved my own confidence in code and how I approach difficulties that push me beyond my comfort zone.

- The need for grit has never before been so obvious than before I took these coding classes. It became clear that just long hours and a red bull were not going to be enough to succeed. This meant that the idea of failing should not out way the stamina to try again. Teaching grit to myself while in the thick of learning new code is certainly challenging, but it keeps me from burning out after one hard day.

- Having anxiety about my career is not uncommon. One concept in Alain de Botton’s video talked about how Hamlet was not a loser, but someone who had lost. This was an interesting concept to try and apply to my own circumstances, as I have both success and failure what seems daily in my journey to join the coding industry. It is hard not to compare myself to others around me, especially those that have industry experience. I am not defined by my failures, but how many times I persevere and try again. I also liked the statement de Botton said; “Let’s make sure our ideas about success are truly our own”.

## Emotional Intelligence

I got a perfect score in social awareness. This is a double-edged sword; whereas I can empathize with
others, I am also overly concerned with what others think of me. My lowest was relationship
management. I think I can work on my leadership skills and stepping up more firmly. I want to work on
more long-term relationships and fostering the short term into long term.

## Assessing bias

This survey was very thought provoking. I knew that I needed to work on my courage and the survey proved that. I am good at talking to others about bias/issues that come up in the workplace so long as both sides don’t make it contentious. I am interested in talking about things intellectually with others as long as there is mutual respect.
