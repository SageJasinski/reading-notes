# Readings Class 01

- What does “strong typed” mean? 

    - Refers to a programming language that has “strict requirements on intermixing of values with differing data types.”

- Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.

    - As you might know from scifi movies, computer language consists of 1’s and 0’s. However, humans are the ones writing the programs so writing in that language is very difficult. Therefore, humans will write a program in Java to then run it through a compiler to write it in machine language (1’s and 0’s) so that the machine will run the program. However, with JavaScript, there is an interpreter in the browser that interprets each line of code instead of compiling it.
