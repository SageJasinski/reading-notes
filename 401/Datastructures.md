# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

   - The Big O Notation
   
2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

   - By including both a base case and a recursive case, where the base case sets a standard by which the function will end and not call itself anymore.
