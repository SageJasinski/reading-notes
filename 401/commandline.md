# Prep work for Command line

## Command line

The command line is a text based system which allows you to issue orders to a computer from a terminal.

## Navigation

There are many useful ways to move around the terminal a couple that are mentioned are:

- pwd which will show you your current location
- ls which will list other paths and files in your current directory
- cd which can change you directory

## Files

in Linux everything is a file. Linux also ignores files extensions and simply looks at the contents of a file to determine what it is. this means you can make an image file have a text extension but linux will still read this as an image file.

## Manual pages

you can use manual pages to find out more about a command or what a command/key word actually does. These are like the command documentation.

There are a plethora of command which allow you to manipulate files and directories. SOme of these include:

- mkdir which will create a directory
- rmdir which deletes a directory
- cp which will copy your path
- touch which will make an empty file
