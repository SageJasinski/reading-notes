## Object and Class

Objects are bundles of software which contain states and behaviors. Classes are prototypes that can create objects.Classes can inherit state from their parent classes for example a bicycle class can contain different types of bikes.

##  Java classes

A java class can inherit states from its parent classes. I.e. a bicycle class can contain different types of bikes and bikes can inherit state from the class bicycle.

## Binary decimals

For binary decimals the number of decimals determines the number you wish to represent. For hexadecimal numbers after the number 9 you have letters A-F to represent 10-15 so now a single decimal digit can show 16 different values instead of ten.
