## Debugging

When looking through code and Debugging you might run accross a couple diffrent types of errors most notably a Syntax and a Logical error. A syntax error is an error that ocures due to a miss spelling or a miss written pice of code at the line specified. A logical error happens when you miss typed a logical operator and can give you results that you didn't expect or want.

In the past I had encountered Syntax errors and had to go to the line the console refrenced and check all my variables were spelled correctly. Annother error was a logical error which caused me to have to go back and re=think through how the function was working and what it actually was doing. This debugging I feel later on will help me to write code faster and to quickly go through issues and understand what is really going on instead of just trying to guess.

The debugger tool inside your browser, allows you to track your javascript variables and stop their exectuion at certainplaces so that you can tell how your script is flowing.
The points where you can stop certain things from happening are call Breakpoints. If you want to see what code got executed inorder to give you a certain line on your page you can use the Call stack section.
