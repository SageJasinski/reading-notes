## Flexbox

Flex box is a onedemensional design mechanism. this means it really excels and displaying items as a row or column in the best way possible. When working with Flexbox you'll want to know the diffrence between the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is the direction you are currently working on i.e. if you are working in a row then your main axis is along the row. Your cross axis is the opposite axise to the one you are working on, in our previouse example our cross axis would be the column. You should be warry of using the row-reverse or column reverse functions as these, along with others, reverse the flow of the content only visually and do not manipulate the HTML file it's self.

## CSS and Flexbox

Useing FLexbox is great for replaceing float functions in your stylesheet. Sometimes things like vertically cenetr a block of content can be tricky useing the float attribute. Flexboxes make manipulating content on an HTML page easy and quick which is time saving especially when working on complex issues at future jobs.
